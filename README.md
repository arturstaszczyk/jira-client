# Jira Client

This application's aim is to make interaction with JIRA more smooth and powerful. At the same time it serves as a programming playground for me, to try out new patterns, new stuff and to learn. I hope to create something useful at the same time learning as much as I can. Currently supported features are:
* Search for issues
* Basic reporting based on Pivot Grid filled with found issues
* Generation of cards for Scrum Board with found issues.
