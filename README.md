# Jira Assistant

This application's aim is to make interaction with JIRA more pleasant and powerful. At the same time it serves as a programming playground for me, to try out new patterns, new stuff and to learn. I hope to create something useful at the same time learning as much as I can. Currently supported features are:
* Browsing JIRA Agile boards and sprints (in case of Scrum Board)
* Search for issues and save filters
* Pivot reporting
* Print Scrum cards either for sprint or for any set of issues with customizable card template (includes ability to place color tags on any card before printing)
* Analysis of open Epics
* Inspection of Scrum Team velocity and capacity
* "_Issues Graveyard_" - hints on which tasks that should probably be already closed
* Export list of issues to text or Confluence Markup
* Auto-updater
* Watch selected project for toast-like updates when something changes (updated or created issues)
* Get prompted to log work for issues on which user worked recently.
